# Building Felucca

The build makes three files in `build/`:

| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `felucca.bin` | the firmware app |
| `loader/ota.bin` | the update loader |
| `felucca.fwsc` | the installable package (app + loader) |

## Prerequisites (macOS)

- Python 3 with Pillow and fontTools: `pip3 install Pillow fonttools` (the UI font and icons are
  rasterised at build time)
- Docker Desktop. The JieLi toolchain is Linux x86-64 only; the build runs each tool in a
  `linux/amd64` `debian:bookworm-slim` container (Rosetta on Apple silicon). Keep the source
  tree in a folder Docker can share, e.g. under `/Users`.
- The JieLi Linux toolchain (clang 4.0.1 for pi32v2, from JieLi's package server):

  ```
  tools/get_toolchain.sh            # installs to ~/.jieli/toolchain
  ```

- The JieLi AC79 SDK (Apache-2.0). The package uses three of its files
  (`cpu/wl82/tools/uboot.boot`, `cfg_tool.bin`, `cfg/eq_cfg_hw.bin`); they are not part of this tree.

  ```
  git clone --depth 1 --branch AC79NN_SDK_V1.2.1_2023-12-13 \
      https://gitee.com/Jieli-Tech/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK.git ~/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK
  ```

- Node.js (optional, for the web tests).
- Emscripten (optional, `emcc`: the browser emulator, `web/emu/`).

On Linux x86-64 the toolchain runs natively and Docker is not needed.

## Build

```
./build.sh
```

`JIELI_TOOLCHAIN` and `AC79_SDK` override the default locations
(`~/.jieli/toolchain`, `~/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK`).

`./build.sh --release 1.0` makes a release build: the package identity becomes `FM-1_910`
and the version string `v1.0`; the package is `build/felucca-1.0.fwsc`, and
`build/release-1.0/` holds what a release ships: the package, the app
(`felucca-1.0-app.bin`), `SHA256SUMS`, the sample attribution, `LICENSE`, `LICENSING.md` and
`LICENSES/` (the package contains Apache-2.0 SDK files, so the licence texts travel with it).

Build options (environment, `0` or `1`; defaults in `firmware/src/felucca.c`, `core.h` and `icons.c`):

| Flag | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FELUCCA_FLASH` | 1 | settings, presets and projects in flash |
| `FELUCCA_OTA` | 1 | update entry (needs `FELUCCA_FLASH`) |
| `FELUCCA_CDC` | 1 | USB serial console |
| `FELUCCA_CDC_DEFAULT` | 1 | `0`: the console is built in but left out of USB from boot (as MENU > USB SERIAL OFF) |
| `FELUCCA_UAC` | 1 | USB audio input (the master output, stereo, 44.1 or 48 kHz) |
| `FELUCCA_UAC_48K` | 1 | `0`: the USB audio input at 44.1 kHz only, as up to 1.0.5.2 (`firmware/src/usb.c`) |
| `FELUCCA_UAC_AS_FIRST` | 1 | the audio control header lists the audio streaming interface before the MIDI one, so the USB audio driver of older macOS (up to 15) finds it; `0`: 1.0 to 1.5's order, byte for byte (`firmware/src/usb.c`) |
| `FELUCCA_UART` | 1 | TRS MIDI IN |
| `FELUCCA_SLICE` | 1 | the SLICE engine |
| `FELUCCA_ICONS` | 1 | parameter icons on the knob cards |
| `FELUCCA_FM4` | 0 | the retired DIGITAL engine (4-operator FM) instead of its FM6 conversion |

`FELUCCA_USB_LAYOUT` (`0` to `3`, default `0`) picks other USB descriptor layouts for testing; see
`firmware/src/usb.c`.

## Samples

The CC0 instrument samples that the SAMPLE engine uses are in `assets/samples-cc0/`
(Versilian Studios, see `ATTRIBUTION.txt` there). `tools/fetch_cc0.py` downloads them
again from the source repositories. Without that folder the build still works, with no
instrument sets in the SAMPLE engine and no PIANO in SLICE (the PIANO set's middle C): they play a plain sine
at the note's pitch instead, and the screen says NO SAMPLE.

## Browser emulator

```
./build.sh
web/emu/build.sh
python3 -m http.server -d build/emu 8790     # open http://localhost:8790/
```

`web/emu/felucca_web.c` builds the firmware's sources as the host tests do, against a simulated FM-1, and
Emscripten compiles it to WebAssembly (`build/emu/felucca.wasm`, with `index.html`, `worklet.js` and the font in `fonts/`). The page
keeps the flash's storage sectors (projects, user presets, settings) in the browser. Not emulated: USB (audio,
MIDI out, the editor, updates), TRS MIDI and the user sample slots. A build of it is on the site:
<https://hugelton.github.io/Felucca/webapp/try/>.

## Tests

```
tests/run_tests.sh
```

Runs the host tests and, with Node.js, the web page tests (and, with Emscripten too, the browser emulator's). Run it after `./build.sh`
(it uses `build/` and needs `AC79_SDK` set as for the build). The suites cover flash storage,
user presets, projects of every format, backup, the keys and knobs, MIDI (USB, TRS, clock,
control), USB audio, the update entry and loader, the command-line installer, the UI (the real
drawing code against stubs: every screen in every palette is rendered and checked for clipped or
overlapping text; PNGs land in `build/ui_new/`), every engine (DRUM, NOISE, PHYS, FM6, SLICE, the
DIGITAL conversion), the chord keys, the modulation matrix, the FX layer, the reverbs, the SLICER
and swing. With `DAISYSP` pointing at a DaisySP checkout, the PHYS models are also compared with
their floating-point originals; without it that test is skipped.

The regression suite (`tests/regress.c`) renders every engine and preset and compares a
hash of each render with `tests/golden.txt`; it also checks levels, voices and the CPU
cost (`tests/cpu_baseline.txt`, `tests/target_budget.txt`). After an intended change of
the sound, `GOLDEN_UPDATE=1 sh tests/run_tests.sh` rewrites the hashes; `BUDGET_UPDATE=1`
does the same for the cost files.

## The second core

The AC79 has two cores; Felucca used one. Now the second core renders some of the four parts of every block while the
first renders the others (`fx.c` `mix_block`), then the first adds them in and goes on (the FX layer, the buses, the
master). The hardware side is X0X's (`hal/fm1_cpu1.{h,S}`, after Melodee's dual-core audio), the split Jangada's; both
GPL-3.0.

- **The split**: each block, the parts go to the core that leaves the busier one the least, by the last block's cost
  (voices × the engine's cost per voice, `ENG_VCOST`); none when that saves less than handing them over.
- **The same sound**: a part's render touches only its own state (its `track_t`, its voices, its matrix `MOD(t)`,
  its SPREAD buffer, its engine memory; FORMANT's noise and PHYS's reset seed per part, FM6's buses on the stack).
  What parts share happens before the split (notes, voice stealing, the matrix's VEL and TIME) or after it (the LFOs'
  S&H draw from the shared generator, part by part: `voice.c` `track_lfo_end`). The sums are integers, so the output
  is bit for bit one core's. `tests/dualcore_test.c` renders 4 parts of every preset and mixes (INSERTs, SLICER,
  SPREAD, the matrix, S&H, ENV SYNC, a PHYS model change under a note) on one core and with a thread as core 1 over
  every split; `regress` built with `-DC1_HOST` renders the golden set that way. `TSAN=1 sh tests/run_tests.sh` runs
  the first under ThreadSanitizer too (several minutes).
- **Units that cannot run it**: on some FM-1s core 1 reads RAM wrong (found by Jangada, measured on X0X and
  Melodee). Core 1 runs only the next job, and only when its check word matches; the first wrong one, or a job not
  back within 4 ms, holds it, and that block's parts are rendered by core 0. A fault on core 1 writes the crash
  record (`core` 1) and stops there; core 0 goes on. **MENU > SYSTEM > 2ND CORE**: AUTO (default) or OFF; AUTO turns
  itself OFF (saved) on such a unit ("2ND CORE MISREAD: ONE CORE"). A crash in the last boot's first 30 s starts it
  on one core. No raised supply (Jangada's BOOST): it is not done here.
- **Where it runs**: its waiting loop is in RAM (`.c1_text`, so an idle core 1 never fetches from the flash). It works
  only inside the audio interrupt, which waits for it; the flash is switched off only with interrupts off, so never
  under it. `fm1_cstart` holds it before the RAM is cleared.
- USB console `status`: `cpu2` (running), `cpu2_gave_up` (1 misread, 2 timeout), `cpu2_bad`, `cpu2_blocks`,
  `cpu2_wait_max_us`, `cpu2_stack`. `FELUCCA_CPU2=0 ./build.sh`: never started.

## Install

Use the web installer in Chrome or Edge:
<https://hugelton.github.io/Felucca/webapp/installer/>. It installs the released package.

From the command line (needs `pip3 install mido python-rtmidi`):

```
python3 tools/fm1_install.py build/felucca.fwsc
python3 tools/fm1_install.py --info          # identity of the connected FM-1
```

Or, to install your own build from the web installer, make a local copy of the site and open it from `localhost`
(Web MIDI needs a secure context):

```
python3 web/make_site.py build/felucca.fwsc dev /tmp/felucca-site
cd /tmp/felucca-site && python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/webapp/installer/
```

Installing firmware is at your own risk. If an install fails and the FM-1 no longer
starts, recovery needs [FM-1-transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter).
